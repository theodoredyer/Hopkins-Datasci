    "### General Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You will be submitting your assignment to Blackboard. If there are no accompanying files, you should submit *only* your notebook and it should be named using *only* your JHED id: fsmith79.ipynb for example if your JHED id were \"fsmith79\". If the assignment requires additional files, you should name the *folder/directory* your JHED id and put all items in that folder/directory, ZIP it up (only ZIP...no other compression), and submit it to Blackboard.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * do **not** use absolute paths in your notebooks. All resources should appear in the same directory as the rest of your assignments.\n",
    "    * the directory **must** be named your JHED id and **only** your JHED id.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Data Science is as much about what you write (communicating) as the code you execute (researching). In many places, you will be required to execute code and discuss both the purpose and the result. Additionally, Data Science is about reproducibility and transparency. This includes good communication with your team and possibly with yourself. Therefore, you must show **all** work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Avail yourself of the Markdown/Codecell nature of the notebook. If you don't know about Markdown, look it up. Your notebooks should not look like ransom notes. Don't make everything bold. Clearly indicate what question you are answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submit a cleanly executed notebook. It should say `In [1]` for the first codecell and increase by 1 throughout."
